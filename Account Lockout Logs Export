# Exports account lockout events into a CSV or Text to track down where they are coming from.  
# If there's no source, then they are trying to login through a VPN or something else that's AD integrated.
# I've found infected servers and open ports with this.  Can take a while to run depending on log size.  
# Advanced auditing GPO will need to be setup to record events correctly.  - Created by Chas Daugherty
